Let's install the dependencies required for Winboat:

sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose freerdp

Let's start docker:

sudo systemctl start docker

sudo systemctl enable docker

Let's see if docker works:

sudo docker run hello-world

Let's add permission to docker:

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Now install Winboat:

sudo pacman -S winboat

Now reboot

After reboot launch Winboat and proceed with set up.

Beware if you decide to share home folder with winboat if you delete anything while in windows in your share folder it will delete it in your home folder also.
